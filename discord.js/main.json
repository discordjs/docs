API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).\n\n- Object-oriented\n- Predictable abstractions\n- Performant\n- 100% coverage of the Discord API\n\n## Installation\n\n**Node.js 16.11.0 or newer is required.**\n\n```sh\nnpm install discord.js\nyarn add discord.js\npnpm add discord.js\nbun add discord.js\n```\n\n### Optional packages\n\n- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)\n- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)\n- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)\n- [@discordjs/voice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice) for interacting with the Discord Voice API (`npm install @discordjs/voice`)\n\n## Example usage\n\nInstall discord.js:\n\n```sh\nnpm install discord.js\nyarn add discord.js\npnpm add discord.js\nbun add discord.js\n```\n\nRegister a slash command against the Discord API:\n\n```js\nimport { REST, Routes } from 'discord.js';\n\nconst commands = [\n  {\n    name: 'ping',\n    description: 'Replies with Pong!',\n  },\n];\n\nconst rest = new REST({ version: '10' }).setToken(TOKEN);\n\ntry {\n  console.log('Started refreshing application (/) commands.');\n\n  await rest.put(Routes.applicationCommands(CLIENT_ID), { body: commands });\n\n  console.log('Successfully reloaded application (/) commands.');\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(error);\n}\n```\n\nAfterwards we can create a quite simple example bot:\n\n```js\nimport { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {\n  if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;\n\n  if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {\n    await interaction.reply('Pong!');\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login(TOKEN);\n```\n\n## Links\n\n-
